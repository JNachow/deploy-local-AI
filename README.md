# deploy-local-AI
This repository contains 1 file, which is my own personal documentation on how to deploy an AI locally on windows
The reason I uploaded this on Gitlab is because it took me a while to figure out how to get this working, and there is no clear "monkey see, monkey do" guide
on how to deploy an AI model.

In the example I have given in this repository, you have an almost step-by-step guide on how to deploy the Meta AI model with the following name:
Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
